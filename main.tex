\bigtitle{How this works}


\begin{article}{Titles, articles, quotes and figures}

\lettrine{T}{}his document provides features to typeset text in two-column article blocks, add big titles, and add quotes and pictures. Please see the source of this very document to see how everything is put with \LaTeX{}.

\littletitle{Structure}

The document's structure is like \LaTeX's article, but with macros on top. Sections are now \texttt{\textbackslash bigtitle\{\}}, displayed in full caps and accent color. The big title is displayed above on each page, with the page number.

What I call articles (like this one, "Titles, articles, quotes and figures") are in fact \LaTeX{} subsections. There are eight environment macros :

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{article*} : \normalsize

Untitled article.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{article\{title\}} : \normalsize

Article with title.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{accented\_article*} : \normalsize

Untitled article displayed in accent color.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{accented\_article\{title\}}: \normalsize

Article with title displayed in accent color.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{article\_figure*\{image\\path\}\{caption\}} : \normalsize

Untitled article with figure on top.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{article\_figure\{title\}\{image path\}\{caption\}} : \normalsize

Article with title and figure on top.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{accented\_article\_figure*\{image path\}\{caption\}} : \normalsize

Untitled article with figure on top but in accent color.

\vskip 5pt \small \texttt{accented\_article\_figure\{title\}\{image path\}\{caption\}} : \normalsize

Everything.

\littletitle{Paragraphs}

Paragraphs in article are displayed in a two-column fashion, with neither \texttt{\textbackslash parindent} nor \texttt{\textbackslash parskip}, as it is in the example. I provide \texttt{\textbackslash littletitle\{\}} to include small titles in italics to give structure to articles if needed. Text is left- and right-justified, and the \texttt{microtype} package is called to improve kerning and right-justification.

\littletitle{Fonts}

Main font is Adobe Utopia, loaded with the \texttt{fourier} package. If you want a magazine full of math, you can! Sans is Gill Sans, with the \texttt{gillius} package. I also changed the mono font to Droid Sans Mono with \texttt{droidsansmono}.


\littletitle{Quotes}

The quote like the one visible on page 2 is achieved with the \texttt{\textbackslash bigquote\{your quote\}} command. It is basically a \texttt{wrapfigure} with text in it. Be careful to put it at a place ensured to be typeset in the left-column. Otherwise it is not nice.

\begin{accented_article}{Issues}

\lettrine[lines=2]{A}{} few things do not work well with what I have done here.

\littletitle{Things that are not exactly like in the example}
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
\item The figure before articles is not like in the example given, text does not appear over the picture.
\item The caption is not linked with the figure with a rule.
\end{itemize}

~\\

\littletitle{Other stuff}
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
\item Robustness: the user cannot put \texttt{\textbackslash bigquote\{\}} everywhere: it has to be on the left column of an article. A completely blind typesetting workflow can lead to unpleasing surprises.

\item (Under)(Over)full hboxes. I somehow managed to get a \texttt{badness 6300}.

\item Big titles would benefit from aestheticc improvement.

\item A titlepage and other features would be welcome to make this a fully usable template for a magazine.
\end{itemize}

\begin{article*}

\lettrine{A}{}s \texttt{u/GustapheOfficial} said on \texttt{r/\LaTeX{}}: \textit{"Magazine editing is one of those few things that LaTeX is just not the right tool for. (I'd love to be proven
\bigquote{Magazine editing is one of those few things that LaTeX is just not the right tool for. (I'd love to be proven wrong though)}
wrong though)"}, I think creating something original and visually appealing is not that difficult to do, it just lacks flexibility to do really fancy graphic design. However, \LaTeX{} is good to create templates and macros, assuming that the design features will stay the same throughout the document.

Once templates and macros are defined, it is easy just to focus on the structure and the content of the document, as the design features are created.

At the end of the day I found this challenge really cool to go through (I had plenty of time to do it). If people like this project and are interested to typeset things like this, I am eager to turn it into a class and maintain it.
